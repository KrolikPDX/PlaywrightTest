### Problem

Create a script to test [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using JavaScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. 

1. Install node modules by running `npm install`.

2. Create a test in this project to go to [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and validate that EXACTLY the first 100 articles are sorted from newest to oldest. You can run your script with the `npx playwright test` command.

Note that you are welcome to update Playwright or install other packages as you see fit, however you must utilize Playwright in this assignment.
